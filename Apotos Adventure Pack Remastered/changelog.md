## Apotos Adventure Pack 4.0.1

- Removed the "Fix Sonic's Leg Swinging Too High" code as it conflicted with the "Restore Right Stick Camera Controls" code.
- As a result, the L-shaped junction cameras that relied on the code in Act 2 & 2-2 have been altered to avoid freaking out.

## Apotos Adventure Pack 4.0.0

- The final major update for the pack is here! It's another restructure so please remove any previous versions you have (including the SHC build) and head to the GameBanana page to download the last major version!
