## Apotos Adventure Pack 4.0.2

- Removed a mention of the old layout toggling option in the config.
- Disabled the auto-updater. Patches will be delivered from GameBanana until servers' issue is fixed to avoid confusions. Which means you need to come check the page every once a while for updates for now.

## Apotos Adventure Pack 4.0.1

- Removed the "Fix Sonic's Leg Swinging Too High" code as it conflicted with the "Restore Right Stick Camera Controls" code.
- As a result, the L-shaped junction cameras that relied on the code in Act 2 & 2-2 have been altered to avoid freaking out.

## Apotos Adventure Pack 4.0.0

- The final major update for the pack is here! It's another restructure so please remove any previous versions you have (including the SHC build) and head to the GameBanana page to download the last major version!
